Semantic Parsing is the task of converting natural language texts into formal machine-understandable logical-form representations.


 * [**SQL Parsing**]({% link base-taxonomy/sql_parsing.html %}) involves converting a natural language query into its equivalent SQL query which can be run over given databases to obtain the answer from the output denotation.

 * [**Abstract Representation Parsing**]({% link base-taxonomy/abstract_representations.html %}) involves converting a natural language text into more semantically grounded logical forms. Some major abstract representations include: <b>UCCA</b> (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation), <b>AMR</b> (Abstract Meaning Representation), <b>DRG</b> (Discourse Representation Graphs), and <b>EDS</b> (Elementary Dependency Structures).

 * [**Shallow Semantic Parsing**]({% link base-taxonomy/pattern.html %}) is the process of assigning semantic roles to the predicates and entities in a sentence.
