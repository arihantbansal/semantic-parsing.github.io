### Contributing

This research area is evolving so fast that a static review cannot keep up.
But a website can! We hope to make this site a living document.
Anyone can add a paper to this web site, essentially by creating one Markdown file.
 To contribute, open a pull request in GitHub, by following [these instructions 
for contributing](contributing.markdown).

### Motivation

The primary motivation for this survery has been taken from the [ml4code initiative](https://ml4code.github.io/). The base structure and the initial code for this website has been borrowed from the [ml4code repository](https://github.com/ml4code/ml4code.github.io).
