### About This Site

This site is an experiment: a [living literature review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_review) that allows
you explore, [search and navigate]({% link papers.html %}) the literature in this area, by
following a [taxonomy]({% link base-taxonomy/index.md %})
based on the underlying design principles of each model.

### Contributing

This research area is evolving so fast that a static review cannot keep up.
But a website can! We hope to make this site a living document.
Anyone can add a paper to this web site, essentially by creating one Markdown file.
 To contribute, open a pull request in GitHub, by following [these instructions 
for contributing](contributing.html).
